How can I program CRUD operations easier?

NLAN model is a service-specific model with some limitations. However, having limitaions makes things easy.

NLAN tree 

network
  |
  +- <node>*

<node>
  | 
  +-- bridges ==> 'bridges' module
  |   
  +-- gateway ==> 'gateway' module
  |
  +-- vxlan ==> 'vxlan' module
  |
  +-- subnets* ==> 'subnets' module

bridges
  |
  +-- ovs_bridges ==> write code for CRUD operations 
  |
  +-- controller ==> write code for CRUD operations

vxlan
  |
  +-- local_ip ==> write code for CRUD operations
  |
  +-- remote_ips ==> write code for CRUD operations

               :

Sometimes you need to modify a state that referes to another state on OVSDB. ovsdb.py provides utility classes and functions to work with OVSDB.

  +-- gateway -- NLAN_Gateway

  +-- vxlan -- NLAN_VXLAN
  |
  +-- subnets* -- NLAN_Subnet
