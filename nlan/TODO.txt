[1] OVSDB schema analyzer script -- DONE!

Why does OVSDB return a string instead of a list, even if it can be seen as a list in the output of ovsdb-client dump?
Maybe the program needs to refer to the OVSDB schema when converting JSON-RPC output to Python dict.

[2] JSON-RPC error handling

JSON-RPC respone error handling ==> raise some Exception

[3] CRUD
Use crud instead of setrow in bridges, vxlan and gateway.

[4] option

$ python nlan_master.py -t openwrt1 --raw 'ip netns exec ns1 ping -c 2 10.0.1.102'
$ ./nlan --raw ' ... -c ...' fails, since it inculdes '-c' option.
